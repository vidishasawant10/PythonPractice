After finishing the Python Basics, we will move towards the most important part of Python, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). They are the foundational blocks of any programming language. DSA is a must-have for both software development and coding interviews.
These are the topics you should learn to master the DSA.
Arrays and Linked Lists
Binary Search Trees, Recursion
Python Lists
Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, and Slicing
